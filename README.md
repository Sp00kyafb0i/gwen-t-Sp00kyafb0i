This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of the
[_Gwent_](https://www.playgwent.com/en)card game developed by [_CD PROJEKT RED_](https://cdprojektred.com/en/)

---

This repository is an attempt to recreate the card game "Gwent" from "The Witcher" videogame series by CD PROJEKT RED. It is made in Scala 3 but it is not finished as it was a project made for a class and we didn't have enough time to finish it.
